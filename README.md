# eddy-cosmology
Preprint for Astrophysics and Cosmology presenting a theory on inhomogeneity, dark energy, and resolving Hubble tension. 
Version 1.0 - M.D. Thornton - December 28, 2025 - First release of Eddy Cosmology

Updated to version 1.1 - Cleaned up some language for clarity.  

Updatded to version 1.2 - Added a missing set of parentheses in second equation. Added entry for wife and a collegue to aknowledgements section. Correct format for Refrences, changing it from a \section to a better \refrences entry. Corrected minor typos and spelling errors.

Updated to version 1.3 - Significant changes and corrections. Almost a whole new preprint. Reworked several sections, to include and improve derivation and formula presentation. 
Reference section still misbehaving. 

May update a final time just to close the project out properly. After crunching the numbers, still cannot smooth out the turbulence enough (even with hyperdiffusion) to track better with current observational data. Such is science. Still looking forward to Euclid data, still want to confirm falsification.
